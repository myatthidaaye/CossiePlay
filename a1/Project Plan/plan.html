<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Myat Thida Aye<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> JC437899</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p><u>Mission Statement</u>
<br/><br/> -	The purpose of the CossiePlay website is to: 
<br/>
<ol>
  <li>increase interest of cosplaying to a younger audience, particularly, high school students and young adults</li>
  <li>increase sales and revenue generated from custom made costumes through online orders</li>
  <li>increase quantity of CossiePlay party goers by online bookings</li>
</ol>  </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p><u>General</u>
<li>
To tally and count the exact number of visitors to the website, web analytics software such as Google Analytics will be used. By doing so, information regarding:<br/>
<ul>
<li>the time spent by visitors on which page</li>
<li>which pages are viewed the most and the least</li><li>how visitors came across the CossiePlay website i.e. the links from which visitors are being referred from</li>
<li>and links on the page most clicked on can be analysed.</li>
</ul> In addition, bots and spiders are filtered out from viewable data by Google Analytics. <br/>
</li>
</p>
<p><u>Sales</u><br/>
<br/>
The client has specified that one of the main goals it hopes to achieve from establishing a website is to increase sales through online orders which will result in increased revenue and profit. <br/><br/>
Sales can be evaluated by:
<ul>
<li>recording the number of visitors to the site who ordered CossiePlay's products through the website</li><li>recording the number of purchases and calculating the total profit earned</li>
<li>calculating the average number of orders per customer and revenue generated</li>.</ul> 
The aforementioned metrics can be thoroughly analysed by using the Google Analytics software. 

</p>
<p><u>Increasing awareness </u>
<li>
The client's second goal is to increase awareness of its cosplay parties, which can potentially lead to increased revenues through party fees. </li>
<li>Feedback and suggestions can be gathered using tools such as surveys to obtain the visitors' opinion on how they feel about the establishment of the site, and of any constructive criticism. </li>
<li>Thus, the website can be regularly supervised and tailored to suit the visitors' interest. 
</li>
</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p><u>Geographic Target Market: </u>
<li>
The local residents (of Hulkstown) 
</li></p>
<p><u>Age Demographics: </u>
<li>The young audience, particularly:</li>
<ul>
<li>High school students (age range of 14 to 18)</li>
<li>Young adults (age range of 18 to 35)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><u>Reason for chosen target audience</u>
<li>
As CossiePlay runs monthly cosplay parties, it is more reasonable to cater to Hulkstown locals who will have greater accessibility to CossiePlay's parties as compared to individuals who live further away. Those reside out of the town would have to travel the extra distance to attend.
</li>
<li>
As mentioned by the client, CossiePlay is aiming to appeal to a younger demographic, specifically high school students and young adults. They hope that by broadening their target audience they would be able to sell more of their products, and have a higher volume of people attending their parties.  
</li>
</p>
<p><u>How would this website be designed to cater to its target audience? </u>
<li>
Many design elements have to considered regarding the varying usability levels of different age groups.</li>
<li>As the majority of younger generation uses mobile phones, a minimalist web design and mobile-friendly interface should be used. </li>
<li>Social media links could also be utilised as it is highly prevalent in the younger generation. </li>
</li>
