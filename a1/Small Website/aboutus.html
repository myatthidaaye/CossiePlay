<h1>What is Cosplay?</h1>
Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words costume play, is a <b>performance art</b> in which participants called cosplayers <b>wear costumes and fashion accessories</b> to <b>represent a specific character. </b>
<br/><br/>Cosplayers often interact to create a <b>subculture</b> and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any <b>costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage.</b>
<br/><br/> Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. 
<br/><br/>Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons, video games, and live-action films and television series.
